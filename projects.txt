      2. Implementation of New Screens
         - Develop five new screens using Next.js page routing. Each screen will be built as a separate component following Next.js conventions.
         - Use Chakra UI to build consistent, reusable components (buttons, cards, forms, and navigation elements) that are accessible and responsive.
         - Implement server-side rendering (SSR) and/or static site generation (SSG) for SEO and performance improvements where applicable.

      3. UI Component Enhancements
         - Refine existing UI components for a more modern look and improved usability.
         - Introduce Chakra UI’s theming capabilities to update the application’s color scheme, typography, and layout spacing.
         - Optimize UI performance by implementing lazy loading and code-splitting, ensuring that only the required components load on initial render.

      4. Performance and Responsiveness
         - Utilize Next.js performance optimizations such as dynamic imports and image optimization.
         - Ensure all screens are fully responsive and maintain a consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
         - Incorporate best practices for accessibility (using Chakra UI’s built-in accessibility features) to support all users.

      5. Integration and Testing
         - Integrate the new screens and UI enhancements into the existing application, ensuring smooth navigation and data flow.
         - Write unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library to validate component functionality and user interactions.
         - Use Git for version control and follow the team’s branch management and code review process.

      6. Documentation and Deployment
         - Provide comprehensive documentation including setup instructions, design decisions, and usage examples.
         - Deploy the updated application to a staging environment (using Vercel, Netlify, or a similar service) for final testing and review.

      Timeline:
      - Day 1-2: Requirements analysis, planning, and wireframing new screens.
      - Day 3-4: Set up project structure, update theming with Chakra UI, and implement initial UI enhancements.
      - Day 5-7: Develop and integrate new screens with Next.js routing.
      - Day 8-9: Optimize performance, add lazy loading, and ensure full responsiveness.
      - Day 10: Write tests, document changes, and prepare for deployment.
      - Final review and adjustments based on team feedback.

      Outcome:
      The final project will demonstrate the ability to enhance and extend an existing web application using modern React practices, Next.js’s SSR/SSG capabilities, and Chakra UI’s component library. It will serve as a portfolio piece that reflects strong UI/UX skills, code quality, and collaboration—making it an ideal example to present during your application process.
